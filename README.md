Hi, i'm dana almutairi!

I am in my third year at university as a Computer Science student. I have always been interested in coding and learning about new technologies. My interest in Machine Learning comes from how important it has become in today’s world. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing and reading.

I am looking forward to learning more about Machine Learning in ARTI 308!
